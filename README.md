#firstReact

##Description
This is a code along based on [Maximillian Schwarzmueller's](https://github.com/maxschwarzmueller) course on React.js. The goal of this app was to create an expense tracker that could complete the following: Add/ Display Expenses through a Form Component (Including dates, monetary value etc.), Filter results by year, and minimize and clear the form.

While the vast majority of the code is Max's, he assigned various light projects that I was able to implement on my own. This includes minimizing the form component and using react 'States' and creating and using props.
